# Minting-
This contract offers fundamental functionality for token creation ,token administration ,balencs tracking .  
1.The token abbreviation(token abbvr) if "pull" ."Push"is token name (tokenName).  
2.Token supply:Token supply is initially set as 0 .  
3.Balances mappin:The contract maintains a mapping named "balences"that keeps track of the token balences at various address.  
4.Token Minting : The "mint" function enables the creation of new tokens and allocates them to a given address . thte supply is increased overall, and the balance address is updated.  
5.Burning tokens : With the "burn" function , existing tokens held by a particulcar address can be destroyed . If the address has enough tokens, it updates the balance and decreases the overall supply, but only id address has enough tokens.  
  
# Description  
A straight forward implimentation of a token on ethereum Blockchain is "My token" contract.By overall supply and individual balances, it permits the creation (minting) and Destruction(burning) of tokens.It offers a fundamental framework for construction token-related functionality on Ethereum.
